# Notice

~~This tool no longer works thanks to a captcha now required with the bloodcat website.~~

This tool was forked from [here](https://github.com/Yen/BloodCatTrawler) and is being updated to work without having to download the maps from the bloodcat server. This tool works by using the bloodcat mirror to get the data for the maps and using [Mempler's](http://cdn.jse.io:62011/) server to download the actual map.

Thanks to everyone who used this tool!
